# Distribution Infrastructure

Several computing resources and infrastructure are used in the ARTIS data pipeline and distribution. We utilize cloud high-performance computing, cloud-based storage, and local machines to ingest and analyze aquatic resource trade data. 
These computing resources create the ARTIS database that is openly available for download at two access points: 

- KNB data repository (recommended for bulk access)
  - ARTIS dataset - [https://doi.org/10.5063/F1CZ35N7](https://doi.org/10.5063/F1CZ35N7)
  - ARTIS inputs and model - [https://doi.org/10.5063/F1862DXT](https://doi.org/10.5063/F1862DXT)
- [ARTIS website](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://artis-nu.vercel.app__;!!K-Hz7m0Vt54!lRgTLW5izYHJS3GR35_ziGwnBaPIkDO-THMoxuWEoCa14fznUSM1tp1JSXmKswmQowbHEcs2JIZb1qk$) (in beta) 


The schematic below depicts the ARTIS pipeline.

## Pipeline component details:

Original Raw Data
: FAO global production, UN Comtrade, BACI, Sea Around Us, FishBase, and SeaLifeBase data contained in the `artis-model/model_inputs_raw/` directory

Clean Data
: Data cleaned and standardized in R and Python scripts and used in `artis-model/model_inputs/` directory

ARTIS Model
: A model that estimates the aquatic resource trade flows and consumption

ARTIS Outputs
: Model results of trade flows and consumption tables stored in the ARTIS database found in the `artis-model/outputs/` directory

pgAdmin
: Opensource application for managing PostgreSQL (a open source object-relational database system)

KNB
: Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity data repository - database and model distribution point

Heroku
: Cloud hosting platform supporting the ARTIS API - being migrated to Vercel
