# Distribution Infrastructure

Several computing resources and infrastructure are used in the ARTIS data pipeline and distribution. We utilize cloud high-performance computing, cloud-based storage, and local machines to integrate and analyze aquatic resource trade data. These computing resources create the ARTIS database that is openly available at two access points: KNB data repository and the ARTIS website (under development).

The schematic below depicts how components of the ARTIS pipeline fit together.

- green boxes -- access points
- yellow boxes -- cloud HPC
- purple -- cloud database storage

## Pipeline component details:

Original Raw Data
: FAO global production, UN Comtrade, BACI, Sea Around Us, FishBase, and SeaLifeBase data contained in the `artis-model/model_inputs_raw/` directory

Clean Data
: Data cleaned and standardized in R and Python scripts and used in `artis-model/model_inputs/` directory

ARTIS Model
: A model that estimates the aquatic resource trade flows and consumption

ARTIS Outputs
: Model results of trade flows and consumption tables stored in the ARTIS database found in the `artis-model/outputs/` directory

pgAdmin
: Opensource application for managing PostgreSQL (a open source object-relational database system)

KNB
: Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity data repository 

Heroku
: Cloud hosting platform supporting the ARTIS API - being migrated to Vercel
