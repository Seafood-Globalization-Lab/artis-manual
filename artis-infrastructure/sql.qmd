# SQL Database

The ARTIS dataset uses relational databases in two capacities: cloud-based storage and local storage. The cloud-based database acts as a central repository for the ARTIS dataset that supplies the ARTIS website query tools and local databases. The local database is a copy of the cloud-based database that is stored on the user's local machine for faster and offline queries and analysis. 

Below are the setup instructions for both the cloud-based and local databases (from the `artis_database` Github repo README).
