# What does it mean when a scientific name is not a true species name? 

# Why don't the trade totals match what a country reports? 

# How is distant water fishing captured? 

# What is the effect of underreported catch? 

# What is the effect of products in transit through an intermediate country? 

# Why are there sudden spikes?
There are two common causes of artificial spikes. The first is related to improved resolution in a country's production data. If a country previously reported production at the genus level, for example, but then starts reporting production at the species level, it could create a spike in the trade associated with the species name. In this case, one could look for a corresponding drop in the genus level data. The second reason is related to change in the HS code system. HS codes are updated every 5 years. To create a continuous time series, we default to providing

# Why are there multiple rows for a single HS product code in the code descriptions metadata file? 
Products table check why there are duplicates (usually caused by multiple presentations or states associated with one code, 030719, H5 probably HS12, 20 codes with 2 states or duplicates). 
Need to remove duplicates when joining.
