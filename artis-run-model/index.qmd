# Running the Model

There are 2 avenues to run the ARTIS model: 

1) on your local computer or
2) on a HPC (high performance computer) 
  - See the [artis-hpc](https://github.com/Seafood-Globalization-Lab/artis-hpc) Github repository for instructions and documentation.

and 2 sources to obtain the model and model inputs:

1) The Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB) data repository
  - .zip file containing the model code, input data, and docker image in appropriate architecture
  - long term storage of stable model release (with DOI) used for research products
2) Github `Seafood-Globalization-Lab/artis-model` repository
  - latest model code
  - development version of the model -- may not be stable
  - does not include input data or docker image
  
  **We highly recommend using the KNB repository for stable model releases.**
