# Running the Model

## Two avenues to run ARTIS model: 

1) **Local computer**
   - See the next pages for instructions (from the [artis-model](https://github.com/Seafood-Globalization-Lab/artis-model) Github repo)
2) **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**
   - See the next pages for instructions (from [artis-hpc](https://github.com/Seafood-Globalization-Lab/artis-hpc) Github repo).
  

## Two ways to obtain ARTIS model and model inputs:

1) **The Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB) data repository**
   - [https://doi.org/10.5063/F1862DXT](https://doi.org/10.5063/F1862DXT)
   - **__Recomended access / download point__** 
   - .zip file containing the model code and cleaned input data 
   - Stable model release (with DOI) used for research products
   - Will include Docker image in future version
2) **Github Seafood-Globalization-Lab/artis-model repository**
   - [artis-model](https://github.com/Seafood-Globalization-Lab/artis-model) Contains the latest released model codebase
   - Does *NOT* contain model inputs
