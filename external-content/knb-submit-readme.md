Workflow to submit data, model code, and metadata to the [KNB repository](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/).

## Resources

The Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB) is the data repository where the ARTIS codebase and database is archived in a stable version. KNB is a member of [DataONE](https://www.dataone.org/) (Data Observation Network for Earth); a network of data repositories. KNB uses [EML](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/) (Ecological Metadata Language) to document objects within a data packages which can be created via the website GUI (graphical user interface) or through a series of R packages using the DataONE API. 

**Note**: a user will need an [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/) to log into KNB.
