# Submit ARTIS to data repository

## Purpose
- Long-term stable archive of model inpusts, model, database, and metadata
- Open-acess distribution point

ARTIS uses the The Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity [KNB](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/) data repository to archive and distribute stable releases of the model codebase and resulting database. Archiving, documenting and openly distributing ARTIS is a critical component in contributing to the larger open-science and reproducible science community. ARTIS uses KNB as an access point for anyone to download the [ARTIS model codebase and clean inputs](https://doi.org/10.5063/F1862DXT) and output [ARTIS database](https://doi.org/10.5063/F1CZ35N7)

KNB is guided by [FAIR](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) (findable, accessible, interoperable, resuble) principles of data sharing and preservation and issues unique DOIs (digital object identifier) to each data package and every version of the package for long term access, transparency, and informative citations. 

## Further details & resources
KNB is a member of [DataONE](https://www.dataone.org/) (Data Observation Network for Earth); a network of data repositories. KNB uses [EML](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/) (Ecological Metadata Language) to document objects within a data packages which can be created via the website GUI (graphical user interface) or through a series of R packages [rdataone](http://doi.org/10.5063/F1M61H5X) and [arcticdatautils](https://github.com/NCEAS/arcticdatautils/).

**Note**: a user will need an [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/) to log into KNB.
